At Awoo, we take child safety very seriously. Our app is designed with privacy and safety in mind. 
We strictly prohibit any form of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or exploitation on our platform. 
We have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content and immediately remove and report it to 
the appropriate authorities.

Our safety measures include:
• Anonymous use – no real names, phone numbers, or personal data is shared publicly.  
• Reporting – users can report inappropriate behavior or content directly in the app.  
• Blocking – users can block others to prevent unwanted contact.  
• Moderation – our team investigates all reports promptly.  
• Cooperation – we work with regional and national authorities to comply with child protection laws.  

If you believe someone is engaging in harmful or illegal activity, please report it in-app or contact us directly at **devnnm.mt@gmail.com**.

We are committed to protecting children and ensuring a safe, anonymous, and respectful community.
