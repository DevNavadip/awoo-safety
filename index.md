# 🛡️ Awoo – Child Safety Standards
**Last updated:** September 2025  

At Awoo, we take child safety extremely seriously.  
Our app is designed with privacy and safety in mind.  

We strictly prohibit any form of **Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)** or **Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)** on our platform.  
We maintain a **zero-tolerance policy** and will immediately remove and report any violations to the relevant regional and national authorities.

## Our Safety Measures  

- **Anonymous Use** – No real names, phone numbers, or personal data are shared publicly.  
- **Reporting** – Users can report inappropriate behavior or content directly within the app.  
- **Blocking** – Users can block others to prevent unwanted or unsafe contact.  
- **Moderation** – Our team promptly reviews and investigates all reports of abuse or harmful activity.  
- **Cooperation** – We work with law enforcement and child protection authorities to comply with all applicable child safety laws.  
- **Camera & Microphone Access**: Required only for live video chats. Audio and video are used in real time, never recorded, stored, or shared, and access ends immediately when the chat finishes.
