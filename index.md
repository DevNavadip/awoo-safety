# Awoo – Child Safety Standards

At Awoo, we take child safety extremely seriously.  
Our app is designed with privacy and safety in mind.  

We **strictly prohibit** any form of **Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)** or **Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)** on our platform.  
We maintain a **zero-tolerance policy** towards such content and will immediately remove and report any violations to the relevant regional and national authorities.

## Our Safety Measures
- **Anonymous use** – No real names, phone numbers, or personal data are shared publicly.  
- **Reporting** – Users can report inappropriate behavior or content directly within the app.  
- **Blocking** – Users can block others to prevent unwanted or unsafe contact.  
- **Moderation** – Our team promptly reviews and investigates all reports of abuse or harmful activity.  
- **Cooperation** – We work with law enforcement and child protection authorities to comply with all applicable child safety laws.  

## Contact
If you believe someone is engaging in harmful, exploitative, or illegal activity, please report it through the in-app reporting tools  
or contact us directly at: **devnnm.mt@gmail.com**
